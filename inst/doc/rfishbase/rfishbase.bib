  abstract	= {Ecology is a synthetic discipline benefiting from open
		  access to data from the earth, life, and social sciences.
		  Technological challenges exist, however, due to the
		  dispersed and heterogeneous nature of these data.
		  Standardization of methods and development of robust
		  metadata can increase data access but are not sufficient.
		  Reproducibility of analyses is also important, and
		  executable workflows are addressing this issue by capturing
		  data provenance. Sociological challenges, including
		  inadequate rewards for sharing data, must also be resolved.
		  The establishment of well-curated, federated data
		  repositories will provide a means to preserve data while
		  promoting attribution and acknowledgement of its use.},
