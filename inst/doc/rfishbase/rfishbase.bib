  abstract	= {The uneven distribution of species richness is a
		  fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate
		  biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like
		  mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to
		  accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual
		  framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional
		  changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We
		  develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike
		  information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in
		  birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved
		  phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree
		  summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species
		  richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We
		  identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome
		  diversification; the most significant of these lies at the
		  base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef
		  associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate
		  increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod
		  radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and
		  snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals.
		  In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate
		  tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and
		  extinction, providing some of the first evidence from
		  molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in
		  shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living
		  vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile
		  turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for
		  >85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have
		  produced "living fossils." In addition, by revealing the
		  timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate
		  diversification as well as the clades that experience them,
		  our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating
		  particular causal hypotheses of vertebrate radiations.},
